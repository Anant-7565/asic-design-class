# Lab 2
In this exercise, we do the installation of the RISCV toolchain, using the VDI image given. The installation was done on VirtualBox, on a Ubuntu virtual machine using VDI image as virtual hard disk. <br>
#  
After the installation was done, the Ubuntu virtual machine was opened, and the terminal was opened. There we run the nano editor to create a C file. <br>
#  
In the C file, the code to give the sum of numbers from 1 to a given number was calculated, using a for loop. <br>
